* [Sass] - Css language extension to build cleaner and organized styles 

### Development
This project is based on the design provided for A****o front-end dev lead to make a job challenge exercise.
I intend to make the most reusable project(it was the part where I put more effort). So the most of components are prepared to get data from a source and show it. And it should be easy to modify them and interchange them for a new ones for example. 

### Todos
    
 - Improve webpack build and adapt it to prod enviroment.    
 - Write Tests for the components
 - Improve the mobile version
 - Add routing with Reactrouter
 - Implemnent nav logic to apply already done class .active (just to be able to know in what sectio are we)
 - Get the data from a rest api fake like this https://github.com/typicode/json-server
 - Split graphics component
 - Improve circle progress to get the percentage
